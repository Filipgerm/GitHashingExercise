This is the description of the Project. A script in a shell will be created, which takes a 4-digit integer as input and outputs a hash of the input.
After that, the first git commit will be executed and it will be pushed
to the remote repository. Afterwards,a c programm will be written to catch 
the SIGINT signal and perform some actions.
